Ben Weddle - Entropy Options

File Entropy is defined as the measure of randomness within a set of values on a scale from 0 to 8, with 8 being the maximum of randomness and 0 being the most orderly 
data. The graphs generated relate to the values generated by -E in that the low points on the graph are listed as the "Falling Entropy Edge" and the high points on the 
graph are listed as "Rising Entropy Edge".

The reason I am addig "J" at the end of all of my commands is because for some reason I can't get Ubuntu to display the entropy graph with just -E or -F alone, so J 
allows me to save the graph as a png, and then I use the command "explorer.exe ." to see all my saved files in the windows file explorer.
