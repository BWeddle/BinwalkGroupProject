Ben Weddle - Entropy Options

File Entropy is defined as the measure of randomness within a set of values on a scale from 0 to 8, with 8 being the maximum of randomness and 0 being the most orderly 
data. The graphs generated relate to the values generated by -E in that the low points on the graph are listed as the "Falling Entropy Edge" and the high points on the 
graph are listed as "Rising Entropy Edge".
